The extension is as well officially available at the Magento Marketplace https://marketplace.magento.com/akitogo-melissa-address-validator.html

### Please note
If your theme uses a custom button/mechanism for triggering place order, the triggerPlaceOrder function has to be overridden accordingly.

Please do:
Create a Mixin (`app/design/frontend/<Vendor>/<Theme>/web/js/mixins/melissa-address-validator.js`)
For Mixins see: https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/javascript-dev-guide/javascript/js_mixins.html

Add mixin to melissa validator js (`app/design/frontend/<Vendor>/<Theme>/requirejs-config.js`)
```
var config = {
    config: {
        mixins: {
            'Akitogo_MelissaAddressValidator/js/validator': {
                'js/mixins/melissa-address-validator': true
            }
        }
    },
```
In this example we have a custom methods and buttons for placing order - we are looking for button with different classes that have _active class:
